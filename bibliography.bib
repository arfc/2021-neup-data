Our model-based analysis accounts for uncertainty in fuel prices and energy technology capital costs and suggests that market forces are likely to keep {US} energy-related greenhouse gas emissions relatively flat or produce modest reductions: in the absence of new federal policy, 2040 greenhouse gas emissions range from +10\% to −23\% of the baseline estimate. Natural gas versus coal utilization in the electric sector represents a key trade-off, particularly under conservative assumptions about future technology innovation. The lowest emissions scenarios are produced when the cost of natural gas and electric vehicles declines, while coal and oil prices increase relative to the baseline.},

program to limit {CO}2 emissions in the United States in 2009. Electric power generators with
generating capacity at or above 25 {MW} located in the states participating in {RGGI} are required
to obtain a number of {CO}2 allowances equal to the number of tons of {CO}2 they emit. {RGGI}
distributes {CO}2 emissions allowances to the market primarily through auctions, making it
distinctive among existing cap-and-trade programs. Ninety-four percent of the {CO}2 allowances
that have entered into circulation initially entered the market through one of the auctions.
Through the end of 2019, {RGGI} has conducted 46 successful auctions, selling a total of nearly
1.025 billion {CO}2 allowances for \$3.36 billion.
The {RGGI} {CO}2 emissions cap for the nine states participating in {RGGI} in 2019 was 80.2 million
tons. Starting in 2020, New Jersey will also be participating, with a ten state cap of 96.2 million
tons which will be reduced gradually each year until it reaches 67.3 million tons in 2030. Note
that {RGGI} is currently using an adjusted cap that is 21.9 million tons lower than the emissions
cap in each year through 2020 (to account for the surplus of {CO}2 allowances that accumulated
from 2009 to 2013). {RGGI} will make additional cap adjustments from 2021 to 2025 to account
for any surplus allowances that remain at the end of 2020},

sources, the question arises as to the ability of nuclear power plants to follow load on a regular basis,
including daily variations of the power demand.
This report considers the capability of nuclear power plants to follow load and the associated issues
that arise when operating in a load following mode. The report was initiated as part of the {NEA} study
“System effects of nuclear power”. It provided a detailed analysis of the technical and economic aspects of
load-following with nuclear power plants, and summarises the impact of load-following on the operational
mode, fuel performance and ageing of large equipment components of the plant.},

Both analytical and numerical approaches are used to obtain the optimal operations schedule. Key economic figures of merit are evaluated under optimized and constant (i.e., time-invariant) operations to demonstrate the benefit of the optimization, which also suggests the economic viability of the considered {NHESs} under the proposed operations optimizer.

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are known as low carbon baseload electricity generating options, but can they become sufficiently flexible to follow the fluctuating demand economically? Small modular reactors, conceived to address the issues associated with large sized nuclear reactors such as safety, costs, and completion timeline, can offer some flexibility through modularity. However, there remain the questions of whether and how these advanced concepts could become commercially viable for load-following electricity production. From the perspective of integrated long-term energy planning and in a scenario-based approach, this study is conceived to evaluate the economic feasibility of flexible energy productions from two first-of-a-kind demonstration projects; namely a floating nuclear power plant {KLT}-40S in Russia and a high temperature reactor pebble-bed module or {HTR}-{PM} in China. Although both projects are solely designed for electric-application, this study proposes the evaluation of a load-following arrangement through the co-production of hydrogen and the integration of grid-connected battery energy storage systems. All scenarios are investigated using a conservative or a reasonable worst-case approach so as to contribute to setting the bottom line for future commercial deployment of small modular reactors. Findings suggest that small modular reactors can already be commercially deployed in the short-to mid-term, and there are opportunities for further cost reductions through technological innovation and economies of repeat project implementation.},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower {CO}2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic techno-economic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network ({RNN}) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep {NN} to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load profiles, the proposed {RNN} sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

	abstract = {Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past. However, it has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically, Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) algorithms. The presented work investigates two {LSTM} based architectures: 1) standard {LSTM} and 2) {LSTM}-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S) architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures were trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard {LSTM} failed at one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data. It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature.},

The variation of solar incidence angle and the amount of solar energy received are analyzed for a number of fixed and tracking surfaces. The environment in which a solar system works depends mostly on the solar energy availability. For most solar energy applications, one needs reasonably accurate predictions of where the sun will be in the sky at a given time of day and year. In the Ptolemaic sense, the sun is constrained to move with 2 degrees of freedom on the celestial sphere; therefore, its position with respect to an observer on earth can be fully described by means of two astronomical angles, the solar altitude and the solar azimuth. An approximate method for calculating these angles is by means of sun-path diagrams. Also general weather of a location is required in many energy calculations. This can be presented as a typical meteorological year ({TMY}) file.},

In France, nuclear is the first contributor to today's low-carbon power mix and it will, tomorrow, be challenged by the increase of variable renewable energy sources. This paper develops a prospective approach to examine the solicitations that nuclear will have to face, for several scenarios. Results show that, with the penetration of renewable energy sources, the number of extreme nuclear power ramps and amplitudes variations increase, as well as the number of annually required shut-downs/start-ups events per reactor, even if the nuclear capacity was to be lowered. Beyond 30\% wind and solar penetration, complementary flexibility options will have to be leveraged.},

The higher temperatures offer the opportunity to significantly improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the energy conversion cycle. One of the concepts currently under study is the Molten Salt Reactor. The coolant from the Molten Salt Reactor may be available at temperatures as high as 800–1000 °C. At these temperatures, an open Brayton cycle combined with and Rankine bottoming cycle appears to have some strong advantages. Thermodynamic efficiencies approaching 50\% appear possible. Requirements for circulating cooling water will be significantly reduced. However, to realistically estimate the efficiencies achievable it is essential to have good models for the heat exchangers involved as well as the appropriate turbo-machinery. This study has concentrated on modeling all power conversion equipment from the fluid exiting the reactor to the energy releases to the environment.},

This paper reports a dynamic analysis of two realistic {HES} including a nuclear reactor as the main baseload heat generator and to assess the local (e.g., {HES} owners) and system (e.g., the electric grid) benefits attainable by their application in scenarios with multiple commodity production and high renewable penetration.

Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

Renewable energy sources are not continuous, dependent upon geographical location as well as climatic conditions, and require a very large land footprint. Future of nuclear energy is also uncertain because of public apprehensions and subsequent government policies. To overcome the issues derailing these two virtually carbon-free energy sources, a new hybrid or integrated nuclear-renewable energy system is being proposed and seen as an attractive option. Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

Superheating of nuclear steam with solar thermal energy has the potential to overcome this drawback. Accordingly, an innovative configuration of a hybrid nuclear-{CSP} plant is assembled and simulated. It brings together pressurized water reactor and solar tower. The solar heat is transferred to nuclear steam to raise its temperature. Continuous superheating is provided through thermal energy storage. The results from design point calculations show that solar superheating has the potential to increase nuclear plant electric efficiency significantly, pushing it to around 37.5\%. Solar heat to electricity conversion efficiency reaches unprecedented rates of 56.2\%, approaching the effectiveness of the modern combined cycle gas turbine plants. Off-design model was used to simulate 24-h operation for one year by simulating 8760 cases. Due to implementation of thermal energy storage non-stop operation is manageable. The increased efficiency leads to solar tower island installed cost reductions of up to 25\% compared to the standalone {CSP} plant, particularly driven by the smaller solar field.},

	abstract = {Public-sector planning problems are typically complex, and some important planning issues cannot be captured within a mathematical programming model of a problem; such issues may be qualitative in nature, unknown, or unrevealed by decisionmakers. Furthermore, there are often numerous solutions to a mathematical formulation that are nearly the same with respect to modeled issues but that are drastically different from each other in decision space. In such cases, some of these solutions may be significantly better than others with respect to unmodeled issues. Thus, a potentially important role of programming models is to generate a small number of alternative solutions that are feasible, perform well with respect to modeled issues, and are significantly different with respect to the decisions they specify. Such a set of alternatives may aid analysts and decision makers in understanding the problem and may serve as a catalyst for human creativity and invention. The Hop, Skip, and Jump ({HSJ}) method has been developed for this purpose. It is designed to produce alternative solutions that are very different from previously generated solutions. Each solution generated is good in the sense that it meets targets specified for modeled objectives. The technique is described in this paper, and is illustrated using a multiobjective linear programming model of a land use planning problem provided by a regional planning commission. In this case, the method is shown to be capable of generating alternative solutions that perform well with respect to the modeled objectives and that are drastically different with respect to the land use pattern specified. Differences among solutions are discussed using visual inspection as well as simple quantitative measures. The technique can be used to extend the capabilities of existing mathematical programming packages.},

Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant {MGA} alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of {MGA} as an energy modeling technique.},

@report{clemmer_nuclear_2018,
	title = {The Nuclear Power Dilemma},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear power has provided most of the
nation’s carbon-free electricity. However, the owners
have shut down many nuclear plants in the last five
years or announced plans to close them well before
their operating licenses expire, generating a discussion
among policymakers and regulators about the impact
of early retirements. The primary reasons for these
early closures are the economic challenges brought on
by cheap natural gas, diminished demand for
electricity, falling costs for renewable energy, rising
operating costs, and safety and performance problems.
The possibility that the nation will replace existing
nuclear plants with natural gas and coal rather than
low-carbon sources raises serious concerns about our
ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions
needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
 As of the end of 2017, 99 reactors at 60 power
plants provided 20 percent of {US} electricity
generation. The owners have retired six reactors at five
plants since 2013, slated seven reactors at five more
plants to retire over the next eight years, and
threatened to close five reactors at four more plants in
the next few years if they do not receive new financial
support.1
 In addition, Illinois, New Jersey, and New
York now provide financial support to keep 10 reactors at seven plants operating for at least 10 more years.
 The economic challenges facing nuclear plants are
part of a historic transition in the {US} electricity sector.
Over the last decade, natural gas generation and
renewable energy generation from wind and solar have
grown rapidly as their prices have fallen. Combined
with investments in energy efficiency, these energy
sources have largely replaced generation from retiring
coal plants, resulting in a 28 percent reduction in {US}
power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) below
2005 levels in 2017. While nuclear power’s share of
electric power production has remained relatively flat
over the past decade, most analysts project that share
to decline in the future without additional financial or
policy support.
 The transition already has resulted in many
benefits, including lower electricity prices, technological innovation, a cleaner environment, and increased
customer control over energy use. However, in the
absence of national policy to reduce carbon emissions,
the transition has undervalued all types of low-carbon
sources of electricity and underpriced natural gas and
coal relative to their damage to the climate.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists ({UCS}) has
assessed the economic viability and performance of
most of the nuclear power plants operating in the
United States, analyzing which ones are most at risk of
early retirement and evaluating the main factors that
affect competitiveness. We also identified reactors that
have been safe, reliable performers and those with
troubled performance records. In addition, using a
national model of the electricity sector, {UCS} has
analyzed the impacts on the {US} electricity mix, {CO}2
emissions, and consumer electricity bills of three
scenarios for retiring nuclear plants early and two
scenarios based on the introduction of national policies
to reduce carbon emissions.},

The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization ({EEO}) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa and {MARKAL}, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework.},

	abstract = {Wind energy has developed rapidly over the last two decades to become one of the most promising and economically viable sources of renewable energy. Although wind energy is claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation, but it is only one side of the coin. The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable. With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. This paper is aimed at discovering the magnitude of the wind turbine blade waste problem, looking not only at disposal but at all stages of a blade’s lifecycle. The first stage of the research, the subject of this paper, is to accurately estimate present and future wind turbine blade waste inventory using the most recent and most accurate data available. The result will provide a solid reference point to help the industry and policy makers to understand the size of potential environmental problem and to help to manage it better. This study starts by estimating the annual blade material usage with wind energy installed capacity and average blade weight. The effect of other waste contributing factors in the full lifecycle of wind turbine blades is then included, using industrial data from the manufacturing, testing and in-service stages. The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40\% of the waste, Europe 25\%, the United States 16\% and the rest of the world 19\%.},

We conjecture that the inherent complexity of real-world time-series data, which results from the dimension, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of the generating process, as well as from measurement issues such as noise, aggregation, and finite data length, is both empirically quantifiable and directly correlated with predictability. In particular, we argue that redundancy is an effective way to measure complexity and predictive structure in an experimental time series and that weighted permutation entropy is an effective way to estimate that redundancy. To validate these conjectures, we study 120 different time-series data sets. For each time series, we construct predictions using a wide variety of forecast models, then compare the accuracy of the predictions with the permutation entropy of that time series. We use the results to develop a model-free heuristic that can help practitioners recognize when a particular prediction method is not well matched to the task at hand: that is, when the time series has more predictive structure than that method can capture and exploit.},

	abstract = {Environmental or ‘ecological’ footprints have been widely used in recent years as indicators of resource consumption and waste absorption transformed on the basis of biologically productive land area [in global hectares (gha)] required per capita with prevailing technology. It has been employed here to estimate the footprints associated with three low carbon, more electric transition pathways for the United Kingdom ({UK}): described as ‘Market Rules’ ({MR}), ‘Central Co-ordination’ ({CC}) and ‘Thousand Flowers’ ({TF}) respectively. These pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their overall environmental footprint has been disaggregated into various components: bioproductive and built land, carbon emissions, embodied energy, materials and waste, transport, and water consumption. This component-based approach provides, for example, a means for evaluating the implications for the so-called ‘energy-land-water nexus’. Electricity demand was projected to decrease significantly under the {TF} pathway by 2050, but its total environmental footprint ({EF}) was greater than either that under the {MR} or {CC} pathways. This is mainly due to the increase in the use of bioproductive land associated with solid biofuel production and that of the carbon footprint, which are both seen to be larger than under either the {MR} or {CC} cases. Water and waste footprint components made almost negligibly small contributions under all three transition pathways. Lessons can clearly be drawn for other industrialised nations attempting to decarbonise their electricity generation systems, although local circumstances will determine the country-specific findings.},

This paper provides a state-of-the-art literature review of the quantitative and semi-quantitative methods that have been used to model risks and uncertainties in sustainable energy system planning and feasibility studies, including the derivation of optimal energy technology portfolios. The review finds that in quantitative methods, risks are mainly measured by means of the variance or probability density distributions of technical and economical parameters; while semi-quantitative methods such as scenario analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) can also address non-statistical parameters such as socio-economic factors (e.g. macro-economic trends, lack of public acceptance).

Three different scenarios are analyzed, utilizing the Global Energy System Model ({GENeSYS}-{MOD}) for calculations. A major feature is the introduction of limited foresight and imperfect planning to the multi-sectoral approach of the model. A swift transition towards renewable energy sources is needed in order to ensure the goal of staying below 2 °C is maintained. This leads to the underutilization of current fossil-fueled plant capacities, an effect compounded by the prioritization of short-term goals over long-term targets. In the worst case, capacities with a combined value of up to 200 billion € corresponding to 260 {GW} total capacity may end up stranded by 2035, with significant shares in the coal and gas sectors. Contrary, in the baseline scenario featuring perfect foresight, this amount can by reduced by as much as 75\%. Thus, the need for strong, clear signals from policy makers arises in order to combat the threat of short-sighted planning and investment losses.},

	abstract = {The United Kingdom has placed itself on a transition towards a low-carbon economy and society, through the imposition of a legally-binding goal aimed at reducing its ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions by 80\% by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. A set of three low-carbon, socio-technical transition pathways were developed and analysed via an innovative collaboration between engineers, social scientists and policy analysts. The pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their development started from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stakeholders and analysis of historical analogies. The quantified {UK} pathways were named Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers; each reflecting a dominant logic of governance arrangements. The aim of the present contribution was to use these pathways to explore what is needed to realise a transition that successfully addresses the so-called energy policy ‘trilemma,’ i.e. the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable energy services. Analytical tools were developed and applied to assess the technical feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and economic impacts of the pathways. Technological and behavioural developments were examined, alongside appropriate governance structures and regulations for these low-carbon transition pathways, as well as the roles of key energy system ‘actors’ (both large and small). An assessment of the part that could possibly be played by future demand side response was also undertaken in order to understand the factors that drive energy demand and energy-using behaviour, and reflecting growing interest in demand side response for balancing a system with high proportions of renewable generation. A set of interacting and complementary engineering and techno-economic models or tools were then employed to analyse electricity network infrastructure investment and operational decisions to assist market design and option evaluation. This provided a basis for integrating the analysis within a whole systems framework of electricity system development, together with the evaluation of future economic benefits, costs and uncertainties. Finally, the energy and environmental performance of the different energy mixes were appraised on a ‘life-cycle’ basis to determine the greenhouse gas emissions and other ecological or health burdens associated with each of the three transition pathways. Here, the challenges, insights and opportunities that have been identified over the transition towards a low-carbon future in the United Kingdom are described with the purpose of providing a valuable evidence base for developers, policy makers and other stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

The Chinese {CO}2 intensity and energy intensity targets are rather stringent. Reaching the {CO}2 intensity target is difficult even with the optimistic assumption of fast expansion of renewable energy capacity and fast structural change. However, while the renewable energy capacity grows fast, targets set for it are not equally ambitious. The set {CO}2 intensity and energy intensity targets call for concretization of energy policy.},

	abstract = {Energy systems are undergoing a significant shift to renewable energy ({RE}). To date, the surface area required for {RE} systems is greater than that for non-{RE} systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: {PV}, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-{RE}, and {RE} system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to {NREL} scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.},

	abstract = {Water electrolysis is a promising technology for storing surplus energy from intermittent renewable energy sources in the form of hydrogen. The future investment costs of water electrolysis represent one key challenge for a hydrogen-based energy system. In this work, a literature review was conducted to evaluate the published data on investment costs and learning rates for {PEM} and alkaline electrolyzers from the 1990s until 2017 and the years beyond. The collected data are adjusted for inflation and specified in €2017 per {kW}-output using the higher heating value ({HHV}). R\&D efforts have led to impressive cost reductions in the observed period, especially for {PEM} technology, while cost reductions for alkaline technology have also been decent. The overall spread of the cost estimations in the 1990s was in a range between 306 and 4748 €2017/{kWHHV}-Output. Today's estimations for future investment costs (through 2030) for both technologies are narrowed towards values of 397 and 955 €2017/{kWHHV}-Output. Higher automation, mass production, larger cell areas, market penetration and technology development will all have a further impact on the investment costs.},

This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations, models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the {NSRDB} as well as improvements in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the {NSRDB} over the years. The current {NSRDB} provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's ({NREL}'s) Physical Solar Model ({PSM}) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ({NOAA}'s) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite ({GOES}), the National Ice Center's ({NIC}'s) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System ({IMS}), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ({NASA}'s) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 ({MERRA}-2). The {NSRDB} irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5\% and 10\% for global horizontal irradiance ({GHI}) and direct normal irradiance ({DNI}), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface ({API}). During the last 23 years, the {NSRDB} has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as {NREL}'s System Advisor Model.},
